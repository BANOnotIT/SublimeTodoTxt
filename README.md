# SublimeTodoTxt #

This is [Todo.txt](http://todotxt.com) syntax highlighting support for [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com).

## Current state ##

This repository contains everything that's needed to display plain Todo.txt files correctly.

## Future development ##

As Todo.txt is a rather simple format, I doubt that it's necessary to add any plug-in functionalities. I do, however, plan to keep up with Sublime Text development, so once ST4 comes out, I'll most likely be ready.

## Contact ##

## Make me rich! ##

In case you are German and like what I did, feel free to install my [Amazon.de partner script](http://home.arcor.de/der_tuxman/userscripts/hf20.partnerlinks.user.js) (requires userscript support in your browser, like Firefox with the Greasemonkey extension) which adds my "tag" to all Amazon.de links. You can also lend me some Bitcoins, the preferred address is *1FJngJTiBiidA2HZ81xS9FGdrQmbQe2BHY*.
